# Task Manager (Trello) App #
## By: Bryan Kayne

This is a create-your-own Kanban application inspired by [Trello](www.trello.com "Trello"). I've developed this from scratch with functional, plain, vanilla javascript, I did not use any additional 3rd party packages or frameworks (except development).

- To see this app in *action*, see the live app here: [Task Manager App](https://taskmanagertrello.herokuapp.com/).
- To run this locally, git clone it and navigate to your directory in terminal. Then type 'npm run build-run'
- To see the 600+ lines of (not so clean) code that run this thing, look here [app.js](https://github.com/brykayne/Task-Mgr-App/blob/master/scripts/app.js).

### Goals of this Project
- To experiment writing JavaScript in a functional style
- To build a small application with no third party dependencies
- To understand modern development tools by manually configuring them

### Lessons Learned
- **Data binding is exceptionally difficult** when you don't use unique ID's and when you're not using third party libraries. At times I added the model directly to an HTML object, which is a BIG no-no *(refactoring in progress)*.
- **Making an application from scratch is not easy.** I've developed this application totally 100% from scratch-JavaScript and Styling (and with a little help from my buddy Will Kashdan, he deserves a shoutout!). Given a computer with a text editor (I love Atom), terminal, web browser, and dev compiler/dependency manager, I could create a simple JavaScript application.
- **Use a CSS Framework.** As you can see, the app doesn't really look good. I'm totally 100% aware of this. That's because all of the CSS (Using SASS) is from scratch, from my mind. I ran into so many challenges with styling, and I will never ever custom style something again unless someone absolutely requires it.

### Conclusion
From creating this project from scratch I learned an unbelievable amount about vanilla JavaScript. In addition, I'm now able to understand the interaction and reason for the Model View Controller. Finally, as I move towards using frameworks, like React, Angular, I'll understand their value.


#### Other Fun Facts:
- This project took me 1.5 months, about 25 hours per week.
- I had no idea how difficult this would be when I started
- I want to refactor this to use ES6 classes, but boy do I need a break... Until next time...
